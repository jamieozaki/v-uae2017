        <br><br/>2. Enough pocket money to last for 5 days, which you may spend on food, drinks, transportation, V-Con merchandise, souvenirs, etc. Make sure to have your money either in USD or AED. 
        <br><br/>3. Clothes good for 5 days. Make sure to bring extra shirts or towels as it is extra warm in Dubai around this time.
        <br><br/>4. Bring a mobile phone with you as well to make sure that you can
        keep in touch with your team and loved ones. Donâ€™t forget to bring a powerbank as well to make sure you can recharge your phone and other gadgets anytime.

        you can show to your family and future prospects when you go back home.
